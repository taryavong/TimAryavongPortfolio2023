# TimAryavongPortfolio2023
A repository for my porfolio.
Mar 11, 2023 - I will be adding a live site preview once I have enough backend written up.
Mar 13, 2023 - Added database connections and some CRUD, plan to add JWT for data security after making sone front to back end connections. 
Added userModel to be used with JWT
Recollecting that in a MERN stack RESTful api, the CRUD operations are organized via. the MVC architecture.
Mar 14, 2023 - worked on JWT and middleware to protect routes via bcrypt and jsonwebtoken packages. users must be logged in and acquire an authenticated token in order to CRUD. Email still needs to be validated.
Mar 15, 2023 - Testing full stack authentication, using dev package concurrently to run frontend and backend at the same time. First time using Redux. Using Axios for front to back communication. Added react-toastify. Note to self: Must be sure to read some react documentation.
